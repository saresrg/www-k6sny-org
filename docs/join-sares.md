# Join SARES

"The Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) consists of licensed amateurs who have voluntarily registered their qualifications and equipment, with their local ARES leadership, for communications duty in the public service when disaster strikes." &mdash; [American Radio Relay League (ARRL)](https://www.arrl.org/ares)

## Get Licensed

To join SARES, you must be a licensed amateur radio operator.

[Getting licensed](https://www.arrl.org/getting-licensed) involves passing an examination covering technical and regulatory topics. Several local organizations offer [in-person exam preparation and testing](https://www.scc-ares-races.org/about/get-started/license). For self-study, the ARRL and other organizations publish study materials, for example, [The ARRL Ham Radio License Manual](https://www.arrl.org/studying-for-a-technician-license).

If you prefer to do this online, [hamstudy.org](https://hamstudy.org/) is a good starting point. Numerous websites host online practice examms, for example, [aa9pw.com](https://www.aa9pw.com/) and [eham.net](https://www.eham.net/exams/). Finally, you can download the [exam question pools](http://www.arrl.org/question-pools) from the ARRL.
